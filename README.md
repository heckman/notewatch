# notewatch

## ABANDONED

Watches a directory tree for changes and updates the notes (currently markdown files) within.

This is was barely started before being abandoned.

For now I'm using obsidian to handle internal links,
but I'm most often using typora for editing.
I'm not entirely happy with this setup
and at some point I'll probably come back
to self-rolling something like this.
